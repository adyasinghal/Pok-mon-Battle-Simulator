# Pok-mon-Battle-Simulator

This is a command-line Pokémon battle simulator written in Java, created as an Object-Oriented Programming lab assignment.  
The project demonstrates core OOP principles including inheritance, encapsulation, and abstract classes by simulating battles between Pokémon trainers.  

The simulation is managed by a central OakJournal class, which allows users to add trainers, add Pokémon to their teams, and run a "Showdown" battle.  

## Features

- Interactive CLI: A simple command-line interface (CLI) to manage the simulation.
- Trainer Management: Create new trainers and add them to the journal.
- Pokémon Teams: Add Pokémon to a trainer's 6-slot team.
- Battle Showdown: Pit two trainers against each other in a 6-round battle.
- Type-Based Logic: Battle resolution is based on a "Fire > Grass > Water > Fire" type-advantage system.
- OOP Structure: Clear separation of concerns using pokemon, trainer, and oak packages.
